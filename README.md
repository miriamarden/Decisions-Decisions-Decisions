# Decisions-Decisions-Decisions

Welcome to "The Brown Experience," a choose-your-own adventure game that doubles as a test of your decision-making techniques. To play, install Pygame and download this repository. This repositoy includes the game script, ptext module script, and all image and sound files referenced in the game. The final version of the game is in the file titled "gamma_version." The script ptext.py must also be in the directory; this script from a public repository on github and is also imported into gamma_version. Click the green "run" button. A game window should pop up. From there, follow the instructions that the bear gives you. Your job is to use the up, down, left, and right arrow keys to move the bear to either the big "A" or the big "B" at the bottom of the screen, depending on whether you want to choose option A or option B. After making each choice, you should be presented with a new choice and a new set of options.

At the end of the game, the bear will tell you if your choices align more with normative decision theories or descriptive decision theories. Normative decision-making theories assume that the deciding agent is fully rational. Descriptive decision-making theories, on the other hand, relax this rationality assumption and consider the biases that many people display in their everyday lives. 

For a detailed explanation of which choices in the game are normative and which are descriptive, see our project proposal.
